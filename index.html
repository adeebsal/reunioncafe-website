    <p>Reunion Café is founded on the principle of providing a unique and tasteful dining experience, crafted around a Mediterranean origin. We aim to provide great food and a home-style hospitality without the constraints of a traditional restaurant. </p><p>Our flavors range from the distinctive Greek gyros to the spiced and aromatic South Asian curry and kebabs. With our menu, there&#39;s something for everyone. </p><p>Our lunch and dinner menu consists of our deli sandwiches, salads, and platters. Our platters are served with a choice of white or yellow rice, and come with a side salad and a side of pita and hummus.</p>
